# Victron Instant Readout Integration (JP)

_This is forked from https://github.com/keshavdv/victron-hacs just for the purpose of working around some issues with BLE updates._

_This fork will go away once https://github.com/keshavdv/victron-hacs/issues/123, https://github.com/keshavdv/victron-hacs/issues/99 etc are fixed._

_Unless you currently have issues getting data, you are probably better off using the plugin from that repo_
